# text_adventure
This is a simple text-adventure game in which you have to talk to the king, accept his quest, navigate the forest paths, avoid the legendary sirens, arrive at the graveyard, maybe kick a door, pick up a key, open said door, and face monsters in the shadowy heart of the catacomb in which you have entered. 
Have fun!
